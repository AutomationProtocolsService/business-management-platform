## Prerequisites

Before beginning, ensure you have:

- A GitHub account (create one at [github.com](https://github.com))
- Git installed on your local machine (if planning to work locally)
- Owner/administrator access to your Replit project

## Setting Up a GitHub Repository

1. **Create a new repository on GitHub**:
   - Log in to GitHub
   - Click the "+" icon in the top right and select "New repository"
   - Name your repository (e.g., "business-management-platform")
   - Add a description (optional)
   - Choose visibility (public or private)
   - DO NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license if you're importing an existing project
   - Click "Create repository"

2. **Make note of the repository URL**:
   - It will look like: `https://github.com/yourusername/business-management-platform.git`

## Connecting Replit to GitHub

### Method 1: Using Replit's GitHub Integration

1. Open your project in Replit
2. Click on the "Version Control" tab in the left sidebar (Git icon)
3. Click "Connect to GitHub"
4. Authorize Replit to access your GitHub account if prompted
5. Select the repository you created
6. Follow the prompts to complete the connection

### Method 2: Manual Git Configuration in Replit Shell

1. Open your project in Replit
2. Open the Shell tab
3. Initialize a Git repository (if not already initialized):
   ```bash
   git init
   ```

4. Configure Git with your identity:
   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
   ```

5. Add the GitHub repository as a remote:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/business-management-platform.git
   ```

## Pushing Code to GitHub

1. **Prepare your files**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

2. **Commit the changes**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Initial commit: Full application codebase"
   ```

3. **Push to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## Automating Deployments

You can set up GitHub Actions to automatically deploy your code when changes are pushed to GitHub.

### Setting Up GitHub Actions

1. Create a directory for GitHub workflows:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .github/workflows
   ```

2. Create a deployment workflow file:
   ```bash
   touch .github/workflows/deploy.yml
   ```

3. Add the following content to the file (adjust as needed):

```yaml
name: Deploy to Production

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '20.x'
          
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
        
      - name: Build application
        run: npm run build
        
      - name: Deploy to production
        # Replace with your preferred deployment method
        # This is just a placeholder
        run: |
          echo "Deploying application..."
          # Add your deployment commands here
```

4. Commit and push this workflow file:
   ```bash
   git add .github/workflows/deploy.yml
   git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions deployment workflow"
   git push
   ```

## Collaboration Best Practices

When working with a team on GitHub:

### Branch Management

1. **Create feature branches**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/new-feature-name
   ```

2. **Commit changes to your branch**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Descriptive commit message"
   ```

3. **Push your branch to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin feature/new-feature-name
   ```

4. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub to merge your changes into the main branch

### Pull Request Process

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click "Pull Requests" > "New Pull Request"
3. Select your feature branch as the "compare" branch
4. Review the changes and click "Create Pull Request"
5. Add a title and description
6. Request reviewers if working with a team
7. Merge once approved

### Code Reviews

When reviewing code:

1. Check for functionality - does it work as expected?
2. Verify code quality and adherence to project standards
3. Look for security issues
4. Test for edge cases
5. Provide constructive feedback

### Keeping Your Repository Clean

1. **Update your local repository regularly**:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **Rebase your feature branches**:
   ```bash
   git checkout feature/your-feature
   git rebase main
   ```

3. **Delete merged branches**:
   ```bash
   git branch -d feature/completed-feature
   ```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Authentication Problems

If you encounter authentication issues:

1. Generate a GitHub Personal Access Token:
   - Go to GitHub > Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens
   - Generate a new token with appropriate permissions
   - Copy the token

2. Use the token for authentication:
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin https://<your-username>:<your-token>@github.com/yourusername/business-management-platform.git
   ```

### Merge Conflicts

When encountering merge conflicts:

1. Pull the latest changes:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. Resolve conflicts by editing the conflicted files
3. Add resolved files:
   ```bash
   git add <resolved-file>
   ```

4. Complete the merge:
   ```bash
   git commit
   ```
