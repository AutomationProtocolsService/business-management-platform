 can tell you with almost 100% certainty: Your database is safe. The original employee data has not been overwritten. This is a visual bug happening on the client-side due to incorrect "state management."

The Diagnosis: What is Happening
Think of it like this:

The Filing Cabinet (Your Database): Your database is your permanent, correct record of all employees. It's safe and sound.
The Local Copy (The UI's State): To display the list of employees, the frontend makes a "photocopy" of the list and holds it in memory. This is called "state".
The Confused Clerk (The Buggy Code): When you successfully create a new employee, the backend sends that single new record back to the frontend. The code that's supposed to just add this one new employee to the "photocopied" list is getting confused. Instead of just adding the new record, it's looping through every single record in the copy and incorrectly applying the new employee's name and department to all of them.
The problem is in the code that handles the successful response from the "Create Employee" API call.

The Solution: How to Fix the State Update
The developer who wrote this code likely used an incorrect pattern to update the employee list. We need to instruct the AI to find this faulty code and replace it with the correct pattern.

The buggy code probably looks something like this (this is a common mistake):

JavaScript

// LIKELY BUGGY CODE
// This is WRONG - it iterates and returns the new employee's data for every old one
const updatedEmployees = employees.map(employee => {
  return newEmployeeFromApi; // or some incorrect merging of data
});
setEmployees(updatedEmployees);
The correct way to add a new item to a state array is to create a new array by copying all the old items and then adding the new one at the end. It looks like this:

JavaScript

// CORRECT CODE
setEmployees(currentListOfEmployees => [
  ...currentListOfEmployees, // a new copy of all old employees
  newEmployeeFromApi // the new employee added to the end
]);
