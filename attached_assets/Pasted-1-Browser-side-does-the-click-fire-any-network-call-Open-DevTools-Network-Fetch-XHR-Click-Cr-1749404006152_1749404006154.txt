1 Browser-side: does the click fire any network call?
Open DevTools → Network → Fetch/XHR.

Click Create Employee once.

If you see no request:

The form is never submitting.

Jump to section 2 (React/HTML wiring).

If you see a request (e.g. POST /api/employees) but it’s ⌛ pending or red:

Note the status code and response in Preview/ Response.

Jump to section 3 (Express/Prisma).

2 React/HTML wiring – common silent killers
Symptom	Fix
Button has no type="submit"	<Button type="submit" …>
Button outside <form> tag	Wrap the whole modal body in <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>…</form>
onSubmit={form.handleSubmit(...)} missing	Import and wire React-Hook-Form the same way as the Survey form.
Mutation not called	In the submit handler add await createEmployeeMutation.mutateAsync(data) (console-log right before it to ensure it runs).
Modal’s Save button is disabled (grey) forever	RHF validation failing – add console.log(formState.errors) to see which field is unhappy.

Quick test: add a console.log("clicked") to the button’s onClick.
If it prints but the network tab is still empty, the early return is inside handleSubmit (validation).

3 Express / Prisma – request arrives but fails
Look at the first red request line in Network:

Status	Probable cause	Patch
404	Route not mounted	app.use('/api/employees', employeeRouter)
401	No session	The Employees screen missed useAuth(); log out/in or send credentials with fetch.
415	Content-Type missing	headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } in fetcher
400 "employee name is required"	Backend zod schema stricter than form – add that field or mark it optional	
500	Console / server log shows stack trace. Most frequent:
• invalid tenant_id
• duplicate email unique constraint
• date cast error	Use the exact error message:
prisma.employee.create({ data }) expects strings for dates; convert in handler.
Add tenant_id: req.tenantId before calling Prisma.

Every backend error is now JSON by the global handler, so the toast text equals the server message – you can copy-paste it here if unclear.

4 No refresh after success?
If the request returns 200 but the table stays empty:

In the mutation’s .onSuccess callback call
queryClient.invalidateQueries(['employees']).

Check the Employees component’s useQuery key is exactly ['employees'].

What to send back if it still fails
Please copy-paste:

the Network > Headers & Response of the failed request

the matching server log line (look for the same timestamp / requestId)

any console.error in the browser
