I'm experiencing an issue with the "Create Quote" functionality in my application. The UI appears to be working correctly: the button is clickable, and the form fields are accepting input. However, when I click "Create Quote," the quote is not being created in the database.

**Here's a breakdown of the situation:**

* The "Create Quote" form is located in the quote section of my application.
* The UI provides visual feedback when the button is clicked, but no new quote is added to the database.
* I'm using [Specify your frontend framework/library, e.g., React, Vue, Angular] for the frontend and [Specify your backend technology, e.g., Node.js with Express, Python with Flask/Django, etc.] for the backend.
* The database being used is [Specify the database, example postgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL].

**Please help me investigate the following potential issues:**

1.  **Frontend Request:**
    * Verify that the "Create Quote" button's event handler is correctly sending a request to the backend API.
    * Check the request method (it should likely be POST) and the API endpoint URL.
    * Inspect the data being sent in the request body. Ensure it's in the correct format.
    * Are there any errors being logged to the console in the browser developer tools?

2.  **Backend API:**
    * Confirm that the backend API endpoint is receiving the request.
    * Check for any server-side errors or exceptions in the backend logs.
    * Verify that the backend is correctly parsing the request data.
    * Check for any database errors during the quote creation process.
    * Check for any CORS related errors.

3.  **Database Interaction:**
    * Verify that the database connection is working correctly.
    * Check for any database constraints or validation errors that might be preventing the quote from being saved.

**Please provide me with the following information:**

* The relevant code snippets for the "Create Quote" button's event handler in the frontend.
* The code for the backend API endpoint that handles the quote creation.
* Any error messages from the browser's developer console or the backend server logs.
* The network tab information from the browser developer tools, showing the request and response from the create quote request.
* The database logs if there is any database errors.
