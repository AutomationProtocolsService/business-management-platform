Below is a laser-focused checklist you can run in 5-ish minutes to find (and fix) a “click-but-nothing-happens” button in a React/HTML form. Work straight down the list—stop as soon as you see the problem.

#	What to do	Why / what you’ll see	How to fix
1	Open DevTools ▸ Console
click Schedule Survey	Any red error? (Uncaught TypeError …, Cannot read…, etc.)	· If yes, read the stack and jump to that file/line.
· Most common: you referenced an undefined handler or tried to call a method on null.
2	Console-log the click	Add
onClick={() => console.log('survey click')}
temporarily	· If you do not see the log → the handler is not wired → move to #3.
· If you do see the log → JS runs; the issue is after the click (validation/network), jump to #6.
3	Check the rendered HTML	Right-click → Inspect → look for the <button>	· If it has disabled or aria-disabled="true" → some state marks it inactive (e.g. required field empty).
· If a translucent overlay is on top (common in modals) set pointer-events:none temporarily to test.
4	Is it inside a <form>?	<form onSubmit={…}> with a button missing type="button" becomes a form submit.	· Either change to <button type="button"> or put your logic in onSubmit, plus event.preventDefault() if you stay client-side only.
5	Verify the prop chain	In React DevTools inspect the Button component	· Confirm the onClick prop is a function, not undefined.
· If you pass it like <Button onClick={handleScheduleSurvey()}> you invoke it early—change to <Button onClick={handleScheduleSurvey}>.
6	Watch the Network tab	With console log working, click again	· No request fired → your handler returned early (e.g. failed field validation). Put a console.log('payload', payload) right before the fetch and see if it runs.
· Request fired but nothing happens → inspect the response. 4xx/5xx? show the error toast.
7	Backend quick ping	From Replit shell:	bash<br>curl -X POST $REPL_URL/api/surveys \ <br> -d '{"date":"2025-06-12","status":"Scheduled"}' \ <br> -H 'Content-Type: application/json'<br>
8	CSS gotcha check	Add outline:2px solid red; to button in the DevTools Styles pane	· If you can’t see the outline when you hover → another element is blocking clicks (z-index, modal backdrop). Add pointer-events:none to that overlay or lift z-index of the modal.
9	Hot-reload trap (Vite/CRA)	Sometimes HMR loses listeners after an error	· Full browser refresh (⇧⌘R / Ctrl-F5).
· Clear any React FastRefresh overlay errors, then click again.
10	Unit sanity	Paste this micro-button next to the original one:	jsx<br><button onClick={()=>alert('works')}>T</button>

Likeliest culprits (from 20 yrs of “my button won’t click”)
Forgotten type="button" inside a form ⟶ page reload submits to nowhere.

Handler passed as onClick={fn()} instead of onClick={fn}.

Modal library leaves a transparent backdrop on top after scroll ➜ clicks swallowed.

Button state (disabled) tied to an invisible validation rule (e.g. required field still empty).

Minimal working example for reference
tsx
Copy
Edit
export default function ScheduleSurveyModal() {
  const [date, setDate] = useState<string>('');      // "2025-06-12"
  const [status, setStatus] = useState('Scheduled');
  const [notes,  setNotes]  = useState('');

  async function handleSchedule() {
    console.log('Scheduling survey…');
    const res = await fetch('/api/surveys', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify({ date, status, notes })
    });
    if (!res.ok) {
      const text = await res.text();
      throw new Error(text || res.statusText);
    }
    alert('Survey scheduled!');
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={e => e.preventDefault()} /* prevent native submit */>
      <input
        type="date"
        required
        value={date}
        onChange={e => setDate(e.target.value)}
      />

      <select value={status} onChange={e => setStatus(e.target.value)}>
        <option>Scheduled</option>
        <option>Completed</option>
      </select>

      <textarea value={notes} onChange={e => setNotes(e.target.value)} />

      <button
        type="button"           /* <<< important */
        onClick={handleSchedule}
      >
        Schedule Survey
      </button>
    </form>
  );
}
Paste that next to yours; if it works instantly, diff it against the non-working version and the issue will jump out.

Need more help?
Run through steps 1-5 and copy-paste:

any console error text,

the <button> HTML shown in Elements, and

your onClick prop code.

the survey button is not responding

Thought for 11 seconds
Let’s step back and treat the “button doesn’t do anything” as a signal-path problem.
The click has to travel through four checkpoints before a network call (or mutation) happens:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
DOM  ➜  React synthetic event  ➜  Your handler’s first line  ➜  Business logic / fetch
If the chain is broken at any checkpoint, you get a “dead” button.
Run the following binary search—each probe tells you whether the fault is “to the left” or “to the right”. It’s faster than guessing CSS, state, handlers, etc.

① DOM level — is the click even reaching the element?
Inspect → Elements ▸ Event Listeners
Select the button in DevTools and expand the “Event Listeners” pane.
Expect to see click under reactSyntheticEvent → your code attached something.
Missing?

Wrong element is receiving onClick (e.g. child component).

pointer-events:none or an overlay is swallowing the click.

css
Copy
Edit
.modal-overlay { pointer-events: none; }   /* temporary */
Add a native listener in the console

js
Copy
Edit
document.querySelector('[data-testid="schedule-survey-btn"]')
  .addEventListener('click', () => console.log('DOM hit'));
Click the button.

Log appears → DOM is fine, problem is in React layer or later.

No log → overlay / disabled attribute / z-index is blocking the click; fix CSS or remove the disabled flag.

② React layer — does the synthetic event fire?
jsx
Copy
Edit
<button
  data-testid="schedule-survey-btn"
  type="button"
  onClick={() => {
    console.log('🟢 React received click');
    handleScheduleSurvey();
  }}
>
  Schedule Survey
</button>
Nothing else changes. Click again.

Outcome	Interpretation
Console prints 🟢	React got the event — jump to ③ Handler.
Still silent	onClick prop isn’t wired:
• Passed as onClick={fn()} (invokes early)
• Spelled onclick (lower-case)
• Prop lost in a wrapper component — drill down with React DevTools and confirm the final DOM node gets the function.

③ Handler entry — did our function actually run?
Inside handleScheduleSurvey:

ts
Copy
Edit
export async function handleScheduleSurvey(e?: React.MouseEvent) {
  console.log('🟢 Handler entered', e?.nativeEvent);   // <── PROBE
  ...
}
Outcome	Interpretation
Log appears	Handler runs — the bug is inside its body (validation, early return, promise rejection). Go to ④.
No log	The function reference in JSX is not the one you expect (shadowed import, stale closure, mis-binding in class component). Verify export / import names and that you aren’t passing undefined.

④ Inside business logic — is something returning early or throwing?
1. Check guards & validation
ts
Copy
Edit
if (!scheduledDate) {
  console.warn('⛔ scheduledDate missing');
  return;
}
Console will tell you which guard fires.

2. Wrap the whole body in a top-level try/catch
ts
Copy
Edit
try {
  ...existing code...
} catch (err) {
  console.error('💥 schedule survey failed at runtime', err);
}
If an error shows here but React has no error boundary, the UI will look silent even though the function blew up.

3. Confirm the fetch / mutation is attempted
ts
Copy
Edit
console.time('survey-request');
const res = await fetch(...);
console.timeEnd('survey-request');
Timer never prints → logic exited before fetch.

Timer prints but Network tab empty → URL is empty / malformed and fetch throws before the request.

Network row shows 4xx/5xx → back-end rejects; the button is fine.

⑤ Usual suspects & one-line fixes
Symptom	One-liner
Button in a <form> reloads the page silently	<button **type="button"** …> or move logic to onSubmit + e.preventDefault().
Wrapped by a library component (<Dialog>, <Modal.Body>) that adds its own overlay	Ensure the overlay has lower z-index or pointer-events:none;.
Using Formik or React Hook Form	onClick ignored; use form’s handleSubmit.
MUI v5 <Button> inside a disabled <Stack>	Parent’s pointer-events:none stops click; set component="span" or lift the z-index.
State flag disables it	Inspect <button disabled> attribute in Elements pane.

⑥ If you still can’t see the fault
Post these three artefacts here:

The rendered <button …> HTML (copy from Elements).

The JSX where the button is declared.

The entire handleScheduleSurvey function.

I’ll diff them and point at the exact break.

Following this checkpoint path is the fastest way I know (two decades in) to turn a “dead” UI element back on—it guarantees you don’t miss the real break in the chain.
