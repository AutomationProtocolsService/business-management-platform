ROLE: You are an expert UI/UX Designer and Frontend Developer, specializing in creating engaging and user-friendly interfaces for SaaS applications.

CONTEXT: Our application's main dashboard currently has large empty areas when there is no data to display (e.g., for a brand new user account). This provides a poor first-time user experience. The screenshot shows this empty space below the main stat cards.

TASK: Your task is to design and implement a visually appealing "empty state" or "welcome" component for the dashboard. This component should only be displayed when there are no projects, quotes, or other activities to show.

DETAILED REQUIREMENTS:

1. Conditional Rendering:

In the Dashboard.tsx component file, you must add logic to detect if there is data to display.

You will likely need to check the length of the arrays that hold the data for "Recent Projects", "Financial Summary", etc.

If there is data, the existing components should be rendered as they are now.

If there is no data, the empty space must be replaced with a new "Welcome" component.

2. Design the "Empty State" Component:

This new component should be centered in the empty area and contain the following elements:

A Large, Friendly Heading: For example, "Welcome to Your Business Management System!"

An Engaging Subtitle: For example, "You're all set up. Let's get your business running."

A "Call to Action" Button: This is the most important part. Add a large, primary button with the text "+ Create Your First Project". This button should link directly to the "New Project" page or open the "New Project" modal.

(Optional) An Illustration or Icon: Include a relevant and friendly SVG illustration or a large icon to make the page more visually engaging.

3. Implementation Logic:

The final rendering logic in the Dashboard.tsx component might look something like this:

TypeScript

{
  (projects.length === 0 && invoices.length === 0) 
    ? <WelcomeEmptyStateComponent /> 
    : (
      <>
        <RecentProjects projects={projects} />
        <FinancialSummary invoices={invoices} />
      </>
    )
}
