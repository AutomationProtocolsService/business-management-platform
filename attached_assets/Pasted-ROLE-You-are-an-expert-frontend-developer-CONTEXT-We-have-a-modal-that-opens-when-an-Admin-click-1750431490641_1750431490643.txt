ROLE: You are an expert frontend developer.

CONTEXT: We have a modal that opens when an Admin clicks "Manage Permissions." The modal currently has a dynamic title and close buttons, but its content area is blank. We need to add the UI for managing the user's primary role.

TASK: Inside the blank modal, add the necessary form controls to view and change a user's role. This will involve adding a dropdown menu and a save button that calls the correct backend API.

DETAILED REQUIREMENTS:

Add a Role Selector:

Inside the modal's content area, add a label that says "User Role".
Next to the label, add a dropdown menu (a <select> element or a Select component from your UI library).
This dropdown should be populated with the available roles: "Admin", "Manager", and "Employee".
The dropdown should automatically display the user's current role when the modal opens.
Add a Save Button:

Below the dropdown, add a "Save Changes" button. This button should initially be disabled.
Implement State Management:

When the user selects a new role from the dropdown, the "Save Changes" button should become enabled.
If the user selects their original role again, the button should become disabled again.
Connect to the API:

When the Admin clicks the "Save Changes" button, the application must make a PATCH or PUT request to the backend API endpoint responsible for updating a user's role.
You will need to send the userId and the newRole in the request body.
After a successful API call, you should show a success notification (e.g., "User role updated successfully") and the modal can either close automatically or remain open with the "Save Changes" button disabled again.
VERIFICATION STEP: After the AI completes this, you should be able to:

Open the "Manage Permissions" modal for any user.
See their current role displayed in a dropdown menu.
Select a new role from the dropdown, which enables the "Save Changes" button.
Click "Save Changes" to successfully update the user's role.
Let me know when this is complete, and we will proceed to the final, most complex step.
