Okay, this is a different type of error! Let's break down this TypeError.

1. Understanding the Error

TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'user-agent'): This error means your code is trying to access a property called user-agent on an object, but that object is currently undefined (it doesn't exist or hasn't been assigned a value).
Where it Happens: The error occurs specifically in your logging code:
File: /home/runner/workspace/server/logger.ts
Line: 41
Function: req
Context from Stack Trace:
It seems you are using the pino logging library (or something similar like pino-std-serializers).
There's a custom request serializer function (req in logger.ts) used to format request data for logging.
This logging is happening inside your main error handling middleware (errorHandler in /home/runner/workspace/server/middleware/error-handler.ts, line 218).
This error handler likely caught a previous error (maybe the "Invalid credentials" error, or maybe something else that occurred during the request) and is now trying to log details about the request that caused the error.
2. The Likely Problem

The req function in logger.ts (your request serializer for Pino) expects to receive a valid Express request object (req). It then tries to read req.headers['user-agent'] (or a similar path) to log which browser or client made the request.

However, when the errorHandler middleware calls the logger (logger.error(...) around line 218 in error-handler.ts), the request object (req) being passed to the logger's serializer is somehow undefined or doesn't have the expected headers property.

3. How to Fix It (Code Checks)

You need to investigate two main files:

server/logger.ts: Look at the req function around line 41.
server/middleware/error-handler.ts: Look at the errorHandler function, especially around line 218 where it calls the logger.
Specific things to check:

logger.ts - The req Serializer Function:

How does this function receive the request object? Let's assume the function signature is something like function req(requestObject) { ... }.
Add a check: Before accessing user-agent, make sure the requestObject and its headers property actually exist.
TypeScript

// Inside logger.ts

// Example of what your 'req' serializer might look like
function req(requestObject: any): object { // Use the correct type for requestObject if possible (e.g., express.Request)
    // --- Defensive Check ---
    if (!requestObject || !requestObject.headers) {
         // If requestObject or its headers are missing, return a default object or log a warning
         console.warn("Request object or headers missing in logger serializer");
         return {
             method: requestObject?.method || 'N/A', // Optional chaining just in case
             url: requestObject?.url || 'N/A',
             // Avoid accessing headers if undefined
         };
    }
    // --- End Check ---

    // Original line 41 might be something like this:
    const userAgent = requestObject.headers['user-agent'];

    return {
        method: requestObject.method,
        url: requestObject.url,
        headers: requestObject.headers, // Or maybe just specific headers
        remoteAddress: requestObject.socket?.remoteAddress,
        remotePort: requestObject.socket?.remotePort,
        userAgent: userAgent // Accessing user-agent safely now
        // other properties...
    };
}

// Make sure this serializer is correctly configured in your Pino options
const logger = pino({
    serializers: {
        req: req, // Make sure your custom serializer is assigned here
        res: pino.stdSerializers.res,
        err: pino.stdSerializers.err
    }
    // ... other pino options
});
error-handler.ts - The Error Handler Middleware:

Check Signature: Ensure your error handler middleware has the correct Express signature: (err: any, req: express.Request, res: express.Response, next: express.NextFunction). If it's missing req or has the arguments in the wrong order, req might be undefined when you try to use it.
Check Logger Call: How are you calling the logger on line 218? Make sure you are passing the req object correctly.
TypeScript

// Inside server/middleware/error-handler.ts
import express from 'express';
// Assuming 'logger' is imported from your logger.ts file

// Make sure the signature is correct: (err, req, res, next)
export const errorHandler = (err: any, req: express.Request, res: express.Response, next: express.NextFunction) => {
    // Log the error
    console.error("Error caught by error handler:", err); // Add basic console log first

    // Line 218 might be something like this:
    // Ensure 'req' is passed here if your logger expects it
    logger.error({
        err: err, // Pass the error object
        req: req, // *** Pass the request object ***
        // Potentially other context
    }, `Error occurred on request to ${req?.originalUrl || 'unknown URL'}: ${err?.message || 'Unknown error'}`);


    // Your existing error response logic
    const statusCode = err.statusCode || 500;
    res.status(statusCode).json({
        success: false,
        error: err.message || 'Server Error',
        // Optionally include stack in development
        stack: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' ? err.stack : undefined
    });
};
In Summary:

The most likely cause is that the req object is not being correctly passed to, or handled by, your pino logger's request serializer (req function in logger.ts) when called from within your errorHandler middleware. Adding checks in the serializer (logger.ts) is the most direct way to prevent this specific TypeError, and verifying the errorHandler signature and logger call in error-handler.ts is essential.

Could you please share the code for the req function from logger.ts and the errorHandler function from error-handler.ts? That would help pinpoint the exact issue.
