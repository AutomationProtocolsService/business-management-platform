🔧  CONTEXT ─ current state
• UI already shows     ScheduleSurveyModal.tsx   &   ScheduleInstallationModal.tsx
• Both modals close correctly but NO request is fired (checked in Network tab).
• Therefore the bug is **front-end only** – the back-end routes
  POST /api/surveys      and POST /api/installations   already return 201
  when hit via curl.

🔨  GOAL
1. In each modal, hook React-Hook-Form’s  handleSubmit(onSubmit)  to the
   primary button (“Schedule Survey” / “Schedule Installation”).
2. Implement  onSubmit  so it…
   – calls  apiRequest("POST", "/api/surveys",        values)   or
             apiRequest("POST", "/api/installations", values)
   – awaits response; if !response.ok show destructive toast.
   – on success: invalidate TanStack Query keys
        • ["/api/surveys"]        • ["/api/installations"]
     close the modal and show success toast “Survey scheduled” or
     “Installation scheduled”.
3. Disable the button and show spinner while the request is pending.
4. Add  data-testid="schedule-survey-submit"   and
          data-testid="schedule-installation-submit"
   to the buttons so Playwright can click them.
5. Create Playwright e2e tests:
   • tests/surveys/schedule-survey.spec.ts
   • tests/installations/schedule-installation.spec.ts
   Tests must:  login → open a quote → open modal → pick dates →
               submit → expect green toast.

✅  ACCEPTANCE
• `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit`  → 0 errors
• `pnpm exec playwright test tests/surveys/schedule-survey.spec.ts
                               tests/installations/schedule-installation.spec.ts`
  passes.
• Manual: pressing the blue buttons saves to DB and closes the modal.
