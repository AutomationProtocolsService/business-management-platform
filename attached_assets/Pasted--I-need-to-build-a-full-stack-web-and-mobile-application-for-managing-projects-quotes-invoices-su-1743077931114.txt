"I need to build a full-stack web and mobile application for managing projects, quotes, invoices, surveys, installations, employees, and timesheets. The application should have the following features:

1.  **Database:** Use PostgreSQL as the database.
2.  **CRUD Operations:** Implement Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for all tables (projects, quotes, invoices, purchase orders, surveys, installations, employees, timesheets, customers, etc.).
3.  **Search and Filtering:** Provide robust search and filtering capabilities for all data tables.
4.  **Reports and Visualizations:** Generate reports (e.g., sales reports, project status reports) and visualizations (e.g., charts, graphs) using a library like Chart.js or D3.js.
5.  **User Login and Access Control:** Implement user login with role-based access control (RBAC) for survey teams and project managers. Use JWT for authentication.
6.  **Document Generation:** Generate PDFs for quotes, invoices, and purchase orders.
7.  **Email Integration:** Send emails for quotes, invoices, purchase orders, and notifications.
8.  **Invoice Generation from Quotes:** Allow users to create invoices from existing quotes.
9.  **Survey and Installation Scheduling:** Schedule surveys and installations, update statuses, and record project delays/errors.
10. **Automation:** Automate invoice number generation, total calculations, and notification sending.
11. **Calendar View:** Display survey and installation schedules in a calendar view.
12. **Task Lists:** Create task lists for snagging items.
13. **Employee and Timesheet:** implement employee list and timesheet for salary payment.
14. **API-First Design:** Build a RESTful API as the backend.
15. **Background Jobs:** Use Celery with Redis for background tasks.
16. **Real-time Updates:** Implement real-time updates using WebSockets.
17. **Cloud Storage:** Integrate with cloud storage (AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage).
18. **Error Logging and Monitoring:** Implement error logging and monitoring.
19. **Testing:** implement unit and integration testing.

Please provide a detailed plan, including:

* Database schema design.
* API endpoint specifications.
* Frontend architecture (web and mobile).
* Code examples for key features.
* Instructions for setting up the development environment in Replit.
* Steps to implement the features.

Please, remember to provide code examples and explanations for each step. I am learning as I go, so clear and concise explanations are very important."
