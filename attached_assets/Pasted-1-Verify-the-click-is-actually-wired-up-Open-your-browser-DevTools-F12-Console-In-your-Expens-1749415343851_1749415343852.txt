1. Verify the click is actually wired up
Open your browser DevTools (F12 → Console).

In your Expenses modal component, find the JSX for the Create Expense button. It should look roughly like:

tsx
Copy
Edit
<Button type="submit" form="expense-form">
  Create Expense
</Button>
or

tsx
Copy
Edit
<Button onClick={handleCreateExpense}>
  Create Expense
</Button>
Add a quick console.log in the handler (or right inside your JSX):

tsx
Copy
Edit
{/* if you’re using a form’s onSubmit */}
<form
  id="expense-form"
  onSubmit={e => {
    e.preventDefault();
    console.log("🔥 form submit handler fired");
    return handleCreateExpense(e);
  }}
>
  …fields…
  <Button type="submit">Create Expense</Button>
</form>
or if you’re using an onClick:

tsx
Copy
Edit
<Button
  onClick={() => {
    console.log("🔥 create-expense clicked");
    handleCreateExpense();
  }}
>
  Create Expense
</Button>
Re-open the modal, click your “Create Expense” button, and watch the Console.

If you see your 🔥 log, your button is wired correctly—move on to step 2.

If you don’t see anything, your button isn’t hooked up. Make sure you’re using type="submit" inside a form or that your onClick={…} is on the right <Button> element.

2. Inspect the network request
Once the handler fires, it should be calling your API:

Switch to the Network tab in DevTools.

Click “Create Expense” and watch for a new XHR/fetch request.

If you see a request: click it and inspect

URL & method (should be /api/expenses POST)

Request payload (JSON body of all your form fields)

Response (status code & body)

If you see no request: your handler isn’t invoking the fetch/axios call—open that function and ensure you actually call fetch(...) or api.post(...).

3. Handle JSON / HTML errors
Earlier you were getting “Unexpected token ‘<’” which means your frontend tried to parse an HTML error page as JSON. If your new button wiring is correct but you still see that:

In Network → Response, if the server returns HTML (your app’s login page or an Express error page) instead of JSON, that’s why parsing fails.

Check your server logs—are you hitting an authentication guard or missing tenantId?

Ensure your request includes the same cookies/headers as your working “Add Supplier”, “Add Catalog Item”, etc. (you may need to pass credentials: 'include' to your fetch).

4. Common gotchas & fixes
Forgot type="submit" on your button? Then clicking it does nothing.

Missing e.preventDefault() in your onSubmit handler? The form might be reloading the whole page.

Wrong form id passed to form="expense-form" on the button? The button isn’t tied to the form.

API route name mismatch (e.g. you post to /api/expense but your route is /api/expenses).

CORS or authentication middleware rejecting the request and sending back HTML.

Final sanity check
Add the console.logs in step 1 and confirm the click reaches your handler.

Watch the Network panel—confirm a proper JSON POST goes out and a JSON success (2xx) comes back.

If you still see HTML in the response, check your Express route (does it send res.json(...) or render an HTML error page?).

Once you see a clean JSON response in DevTools, your frontend will parse it and update the UI. Let me know exactly which of these sub-steps still fails, and we’ll zero in on the fix!
