Why the tiles slide +1 day (or show odd times)
Root cause → time–zone shift.
You now pass start: "2025-06-24T00:00:00.000Z" (midnight UTC).
Browsers parse that into local time.
If your user is UTC+05:30, the Date becomes 23-Jun 19:30 — FullCalendar then renders it on the 23rd, plus a clock (“12:00 AM” default for all-day).

Installation events keep the original start_time (which includes the real clock), so you get seemingly random offsets: some rows slide a day, some keep the DB clock.

Fast, deterministic fix
We’ll make every event an all-day block keyed to a pure date string, never a timestamp.

tsx
Copy
Edit
// client/pages/CalendarPage.tsx  (inside map)
const dateOnly = (typeof ev.start_time === "string"
  ? ev.start_time          // "2025-06-24"  ❮❮ make the API send this
  : ev.start_time          // Date or string
).toString().split("T")[0]; // keep YYYY-MM-DD no TZ

return {
  id:    ev.id,
  title: ev.type === "survey" ? "Survey" : "Installation",
  start: dateOnly,          // *just* the date
  allDay: true,
  display: "block",         // remove clock
  backgroundColor: ev.type === "survey" ? "#147aff" : "#ffc400",
};
FullCalendar treats "YYYY-MM-DD" with allDay: true as a local-day tile;
no parsing, no timezone math, never drifts.

Make the API return date-only
Option A (coalesce in SQL view)

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT
  start_time::date AS start_time,   -- '2025-06-24'
  ...
FROM installations
Option B (if you keep timestamps for future half-day events)

ts
Copy
Edit
const dateOnly = ev.start_time.toISOString().split("T")[0];
One-line patch for installation rows that really need time
If you want surveys as all-day but installations to keep 09:00, 13:00 etc.:

tsx
Copy
Edit
const isSurvey = ev.type === "survey";
const start = isSurvey
  ? ev.start_time.split("T")[0]       // date string
  : ev.start_time;                    // ISO timestamp

return {
  ...,
  allDay: isSurvey,
  start,
};
Guide to tell Ghostwriter if you want an exact diff
text
Copy
Edit
Calendar shows events one day off. Cause: UTC midnight → local shift.
Need diff that:
1. Changes v_calendar_events to cast start_time to ::date
2. Updates CalendarPage mapper to use date string and allDay:true
3. Leaves Installation times intact if end_time is not null
Return patch for: prisma/migrations/<…>.sql, server/routes/calendar.ts, client/pages/CalendarPage.tsx
Copy that prompt along with the current CalendarPage snippet; the agent will output the three-file diff.

Apply, refresh → squares appear on precise 4 / 11 / 18 / 24 (or whatever dates), with no “12:00 AM” noise.
