## Introduction

This testing guide provides a structured approach to evaluating all aspects of the Business Management Platform. The goal is to identify any issues, validate all functionality, and ensure the application meets business requirements before delivering to clients.

## Testing Preparation

### Test Environment Setup

1. **Create Test Accounts**:
   - Admin user
   - Standard user
   - Limited-permission user

2. **Prepare Test Data**:
   - Create sample customers
   - Prepare catalog items
   - Have sample images for testing uploads

3. **Testing Tools**:
   - Spreadsheet or tool for tracking test results
   - Browser dev tools for monitoring network requests
   - Screen recording software (optional)

### Testing Plan

1. Start with basic functionality testing
2. Proceed to complete workflow testing
3. Test edge cases and error handling
4. Perform cross-browser and device testing
5. Document findings and issues
